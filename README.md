**AI Sports Sponsorship Intelligence Platform**

WorldCupROI turns the World Cup attention market into a sponsorship decision engine. It is not a simple match-result predictor: it blends match performance, media narratives, fan influence, sponsor investment, and uncertainty risk into one ROI decision platform.

## 10-Second Overview

| Capability | Output | Business value |
|---|---|---|
| Sponsor ROI prediction | Expected ROI, ROI lift, ranking | Moves beyond match prediction into commercial decision support. |
| Real-source text signals | Media heat, narrative momentum, text embeddings | Captures attention shifts that tabular sports data misses. |

## Results Showcase

Results come first because sponsorship teams need to see the business signal before reading the engineering stack. The tables are intentionally kept compact and consistent so they render cleanly on GitHub.

### ROI Feature Importance / SHAP

![ROI feature importance](docs/assets/roi_feature_importance.svg)

**What it shows:** Figure 1 ranks the strongest drivers of predicted sponsor ROI, including brand heat, team strength, sponsor spend, ad exposure, sponsor-team fit, and commercial momentum.

**Why it matters:** Sponsor value is driven by both football performance and attention dynamics, so ROI cannot be explained by match results alone.

**Business takeaway:** Brands should evaluate team strength together with media exposure, fan attention, and sponsor-team fit before increasing campaign spend.

### Sponsor ROI Ranking

| Rank | Sponsor | Influence score | Connected nodes | Average edge weight |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1 | Hyundai | 1261.417 | 262 | 2.3534 |
| 2 | Adidas | 1079.883 | 233 | 2.3074 |
| 3 | Coca-Cola | 1046.330 | 235 | 2.2262 |
| 4 | Visa | 1030.583 | 236 | 2.2021 |
| 5 | Hisense | 787.907 | 185 | 2.1411 |

**What it shows:** The sponsor ranking summarizes commercial network influence across team, player, sponsor, and match relationships.

**Why it matters:** Sponsors with broader and stronger network positions are more likely to convert event attention into measurable commercial value.

**Business takeaway:** Sponsorship planning should prioritize both spend level and network fit, not only brand size.

### Scenario ROI Lift

![Scenario ROI lift](docs/assets/scenario_ranking.svg)

| Scenario | Average predicted ROI | Average ROI delta | Average ROI lift |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| A_baseline | 3.850 | 0.000 | 0.000% |
| B_core_player_absent | 3.761 | -0.089 | -2.296% |
| C_sponsor_upgrade | 3.613 | -0.238 | -6.206% |
| D_media_cooling | 3.643 | -0.207 | -5.396% |

**What it shows:** Figure 2 compares baseline ROI with counterfactual scenarios such as player absence, sponsor activation change, and media cooling.

**Why it matters:** Sponsorship ROI is sensitive to player availability and attention shocks.

**Business takeaway:** Scenario planning should be part of sponsor budget allocation before tournament exposure peaks.

### Prediction Interval / Conformal Prediction

![Prediction interval](docs/assets/roi_uncertainty_intervals.svg)

| Prediction target | Coverage rate | Average interval or set size | qhat |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Match prediction sets | 0.9021 | 2.3814 | 0.8110 |
| ROI prediction intervals | 0.8814 | 0.4708 | 0.2354 |

**What it shows:** Figure 3 shows prediction intervals and conformal coverage for match outcomes and ROI estimates.

**Why it matters:** Decision makers need ranges and reliability estimates, not only point predictions.

**Business takeaway:** Sponsors can use interval width and coverage as risk controls before approving higher spend.

### Monte Carlo Risk Distribution

| Risk signal | Current value | Decision use |
|---|---:|---|
| Average negative ROI probability | 0.0000 | Downside screen for sponsor scenarios. |
| Average interval width | 0.4340 | Confidence band for ROI planning. |
| Average Monte Carlo standard deviation | 0.1320 | Volatility signal under scenario perturbation. |
| Medium-risk cases | 119 | Cases needing additional review. |
| High-risk cases | 0 | Current generated panel has no high-risk cases. |

**What it shows:** The risk summary combines bootstrap intervals, Monte Carlo perturbation, and variance-based risk scoring.

**Why it matters:** ROI forecasts are more useful when the downside distribution is visible.

**Business takeaway:** Sponsors should compare expected ROI with risk score and interval width before selecting a campaign scenario.

### Text Signal Projection

![Text signal projection](docs/assets/text_embedding_map.svg)

**What it shows:** Figure 4 projects real-source text signals from GDELT and Wikimedia into reduced dimensions for modeling.

**Why it matters:** Media narratives and sponsor news can change commercial momentum before the match result is known.

**Business takeaway:** Text evidence should be treated as an early signal for sponsor attention and campaign timing.

### Sponsor-Team-Player Network

![GNN relationship explanation](docs/assets/gnn_relationship_explainer.svg)

| Network signal | Current value | Decision use |
|---|---:|---|
| Graph edges | 6112 | Relationship density across sports and sponsor entities. |
| Graph nodes | 1394 | Scale of the commercial network. |
| Top sponsor by influence | Hyundai | Current strongest sponsor-network position. |
| Top sponsor influence score | 1261.417 | Comparable influence score for ranking. |

**What it shows:** The graph layer connects sponsors, teams, players, and matches into a weighted heterogeneous network.

**Why it matters:** Sponsorship effectiveness depends on how brand exposure, team context, player influence, and match stage pass information through the relationship network.

**Business takeaway:** Network centrality and edge strength can help identify sponsors with stronger activation leverage and more resilient commercial pathways.

## Problem

Sports sponsorship is a race against a moving attention market. A brand often invests before the tournament story is fully written, while the return depends on conditions that can change within hours:

- Match importance and tournament stage.
- Team strength and player availability.
- Fan attention and media reposts.
- Sponsor spend, ad exposure, brand heat, and brand fit.
- Weather, venue, and home/away context.
- News narratives and public sentiment.

Most sports analytics projects stop at predicting who wins. WorldCupROI treats match probability as only one signal inside a broader sponsor ROI, risk, and recommendation system.

## Why It Matters

Major tournaments compress global attention into a short decision window. Sponsors need to act before all information is known, and poor timing can turn a high-profile campaign into weak commercial return.

| Audience | Value |
|---|---|
| Sports business analysts | Compare sponsors, teams, stages, and ROI risk. |
| ML and data science reviewers | Inspect reproducible modeling, feature engineering, and uncertainty outputs. |
| Researchers | Study how sports performance, media attention, sentiment, and sponsorship signals interact. |

The goal is to connect predictions to business decisions: what to sponsor, when to activate, where the upside is, and how much risk sits behind the headline ROI.

```

This flow is the spine of the platform: data enters once, features are reused across models, and every prediction is routed through explanation, uncertainty, and business reporting before it reaches the dashboard.

![Architecture diagram](docs/assets/architecture.svg)

**What it shows:** Figure 5 summarizes the platform architecture from data sources to features, models, uncertainty, report generation, and dashboard delivery.

**Why it matters:** The system is designed as a reproducible analytics platform rather than a one-off notebook.

**Business takeaway:** Sponsors can trace a recommendation back to data, features, models, and risk logic.

![Model architecture](docs/assets/model_pipeline.svg)

**What it shows:** Figure 6 shows the modeling pipeline for match prediction, ROI prediction, uncertainty, and scenario analysis.

**Why it matters:** Separating match outcome modeling from sponsor ROI modeling keeps the business target clear.

**Business takeaway:** Match probability becomes one commercial input rather than the final product.

![Decision flow](docs/assets/decision_workflow.svg)

```mermaid

    S --> R["Recommend<br/>lift-risk tradeoff"]
```

**What it shows:** Figure 7 maps dashboard use to the business workflow Discover -> Explain -> Predict -> Simulate -> Recommend.

**Why it matters:** Each module answers a decision question instead of presenting disconnected charts.

**Business takeaway:** The dashboard supports repeated sponsor planning, not only static reporting.

## Dashboard Gallery

The dashboard is structured around a business decision sequence rather than a loose chart collection. Each screen is designed to answer one sponsor question, then hand the user to the next decision.
